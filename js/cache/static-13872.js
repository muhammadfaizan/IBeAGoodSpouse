This is not a gender issue; women are just as prone to this problem as you most likely are. I can‘t tell you how many people I‘ve heard saying, “If I show empathy, doesn’t that mean I agree with what my partner is saying? And I don’t! They’re wrong!” Empathizing does not mean you agree. It just means you care enough to listen and hear what your partner is saying. If empathizing as a communication skill were taught in every elementary school, our world would be a less violent place. Start at home. Now. Allow your partner to speak her heart. Listen without judgment. Then mirror back what you think you’ve heard until you get it right.

Most of us get all bolluxed up thinking our partner wants us to solve the problem for us. It isn’t true. We just want someone to say, “Wow, that must really hurt. That must feel really hard,” to say it with deep concern and love and mean it. Just put yourself in your wife’s place–even for a moment–and feel her pain. That’s it. It can be very, very difficult when you’re in emotional reaction to what she is saying. But that’s the key to all of it–not only to happier marriages but to happier relationships in general. Think of it this way: your wife’s issues are hers, and part of the learning and growing work she needs to do in this life. You don’t want to take that soul-strengthening process away from her. But you also don’t want to continually re-wound her in her hurt places. You need to be her cheerleader, as she is yours.","type":"article","param1":null,"param2":null,"description":"Its not about :\"Don't you worry woman i can handle that\"\r\nits about : \"Hey darling, don't worry you wouldn't have to deal with it ALONE\"","url":null,"id":null,"providerid":null,"hideimage":false,"maxitems":0,"likesno":0,"commentsno":0,"date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},{"title":"Own your stuff","key":"11489","dataProvider":null,"subtitle":"Own yourself","backgroundImage":"/images/OwnYourStuff.jpg","content":"We all have emotional baggage and issues. Deal with yours and encourage your wife to do the same with hers. Chances are you chose each other because your issues dovetail neatly and you bring them up in each other. Commit to loving yourself and all your flaws, and to gaining a deeper level of self-acceptance. Then simply Be There as your wife struggles to do the same. Do what you can to encourage and help with the process. But if your issues are the Marriage-Killing variety, you may need some outside help in dealing with them. Please, please do not fall into the predictable and all-too-common male trap of refusing to get professional help. If you want to kill your marriage dead, this will do it.

Most of us allow the poison of judgment and blame to creep in when\r\n speaking to our significant others. This is counterproductive. Speaking\r\n from the heart means going deep to the feeling place and saying what \r\nyou know to be deeply true FOR YOU–in other words, make “I” statements \r\nrather than “you” statements. Not “You’re thoughtless and selfish \r\nbecause you forgot my birthday,” but “I felt so hurt and not cared for \r\nwhen you forgot my birthday.” Nobody can argue with an “I” statement. \r\nYour feelings are your feelings. Most people get caught in the trap of \r\n“I must make them get it! I must make them understand!” You can’t \r\nlegislate whether or not your partner will really hear you, or how they \r\nwill react to you if they do.
